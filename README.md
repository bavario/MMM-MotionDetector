# MMM-MotionDetector

## Installation

Just clone the module into your MagicMirror modules folder:

```
git clone https://github.com/rejas/MMM-MotionDetector.git
```

## Requirements

Accessing your (web)cam requires to have the client run on localhost or a HTTPS host (due to new requirements in Chrome for getUserMedia). The default value in your MagicMirror config.js is already `localhost` so most users shouldn't be affected.

Just in case you still have problems (like [here](https://github.com/rejas/MMM-MotionDetector/issues/6)) check your config and see if you can solve it by outcommenting the ip-address under

``` JavaScript
var config = {
    	address : '0.0.0.0',
	...
``` 

## Tested devices

So far I only used a [PlayStation3 Eye Webcam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_Eye) for motion-detection at my MagicMirror. If you have successfully used this module with any other webcam, I'd be happy to hear about it.

If you want to use the wired PI-camera follow these steps provided by [@rev138](https://github.com/rejas/MMM-MotionDetector/issues/8#issuecomment-483356950):

    - Open /etc/modules-load.d/modules.conf
    - Add bcm2835-v4l2 to the end of the file and save it.
    - Reboot.
    - Profit

Another tutorial on how to enable the PI-camera in the browser can be found [in this blog post](https://reprage.com/post/pi-camera-module-in-the-browser).

## Using the module

To use this module, add it to the modules array in the `config/config.js` file:
````javascript
modules: [
	{
		module: "MMM-MotionDetector",
		position: "top_left",	// Optional. This can be any of the regions. Displays debug informations.
		config: {
			// The config property is optional.
			// See 'Configuration options' for more information.
		}
	}
]
````

## Configuration options

The following properties can be configured:
